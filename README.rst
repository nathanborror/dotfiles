===========
My Dotfiles
===========

This sets up a system the way I like it.

Installation
------------

    git://github.com/nathanborror/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    Symlink files you wish to use to ~/

Environment
-----------

I run both Ubuntu and Mac OS X but these would likely work in many Linux distros.

Organization
------------

I typically place all my projects in ~/projects and reusable python apps in ~/source then symlink the necessary bits to ~/modules.
